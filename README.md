# Checkpoint-1
Hello,

I'm honored to present my first checkpoint.

About:

     1.How does the web work?
 
     2.What do you need to be a web developer?
 
     3.What is the role of a web developer?
		 
I tried to reach the maximum  of possible sources, and apply my HTML skills and some of my new knowledge 
on CSS.

It took me around a week of code and collecting the sufficient information for this blog.
At the end of the day it was worth it after all.
