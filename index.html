             You don't have to be a professional web developer

                    So let's get started.
                </p> <br>
            </div>
        <div>
            <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"> What's a website: </h4>
        <p>A website is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.<br>
            Notable examples are: <strong> <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank">Netflix</a></strong>.
            All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the <em>World Wide Web</em>. <br>
            There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a <em>Private Network</em>, such as a company's internal website for its employees.<br>
            Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social networking.<br>
            Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.<br>
            Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called a web browser.<br>
            <p>And, just like the address of your house, your website also will have a unique address called (web address). With the web address, internet users can easily find your website and access the information on it.</p>
            <em>The web is one of many ways you can share information via the internet. Others include email, instant messaging, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), etc.</em>
        </p>
            <p>And, just like the <a href="https://www.ipaddress.my" target="_blank"> address of your house</a>, your website also will have a unique address called (web address)
                With the web address, internet users can easily find your website and access the information on it.</p>
            </div> <br>
            <div>
        <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Clients and Servers:</h4>
        A server is a sample of software or hardware that serves a specific service to its clients. <br>
        Web servers, domain name servers, and mail servers are some of the example servers using by all network users. <br>
        A client is a user program that connects to a server to access a service. <br>
        So basically computers connected to the web are called clients and servers. <br>
        A simplified diagram of how they interact might look like this: <br> <br>
        <img src="clientSRV.png" alt="a picture displaying the relation between the clients and the server so the
        client request from the server and it responses to it" width="500px"> <br> <br>
            <li>Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer <br>
                connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing <br>
                software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li> <br>
                <li>Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to <br>
                    access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client <br>
                    machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</li> <br>
        <p>In addition to the client and the server, we also need to mention:</p>
            <li><strong>The internet connection</strong>: Allows you to send and receive data on the web. It's basically like <br>
                the street between your house and the shop.</li>
            <li><strong>TCP/IP</strong>: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that <br>
                define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let <br>
                you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a car or a bike <br>
                (or however else you might get around).</li>
            <li><strong>DNS</strong>: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that <br>
                define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place <br>
                an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a car or <br>
                a bike (or however else you might get around).</li>
            <li><strong>HTTP</strong>: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language <br>
                for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods.</li>
            <li><strong>Component files</strong>: A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different parts <br> 
                of the goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types: </li>
            <li><em>Code files</em>: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, <br>
                though you'll meet other technologies a bit later.
            </li>
            <li><em>Assets</em>: This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes <br>
                up a website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.</li>
            </div> <br>
        <div>
            <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">What's a URL:</h4>
            <p>Uniform Resource Locator aka url is a specific type of Universal Resource Identifier (URI). A url normally locates an existing resource on the Internet.<br>
                it is used when a web client makes a request to a server for a resource.<br>
                Briefly, a URI is defined as any character string that identifies a resource. <br>
                A URL is defined as those URIs that identify a resource by its location or by the means used to access it, <br>
                rather than by a name or other attribute of the resource.<br>
            </p>
        </div> <br>
        <div>
            <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">URL Components:</h4>
            <p>A URL for HTTP (or HTTPS) is normally made up of three or four components:
                
                    <li><strong>A scheme</strong>: identifies the protocol to be used to access the resource on the Internet. It can be HTTP (without SSL) or HTTPS (with SSL).</li> 
                    <li><strong>A host</strong>: identifies the host that holds the resource. For example, www.example.com. A server provides services in the name of the host.</li> 
                    <li><strong>A path</strong>: identifies the specific resource in the host that the web client wants to access. For example, /software/htp/cics/index.html.</li>
                    <li><strong>A query string</strong>: If it is used, it follows the path component, and provides a string of information that the resource can use for some purpose. <br>
                        The query string is usually a string of name and value pairs; for example, term=bluebird. Name and value pairs are separated from each other <br>
                        by an ampersand (&); for example, term=bluebird&source=browser-search.</li> <br>

                People these that the terms of the internet and the web  interchangeably but they’re different technologies. <br>       
                <li><strong>Internet:</strong> It’s the technology that connects computers worldwide and lets sharing information.</li>                
                <li><strong>World Wide Web (or Web):</strong> It’s the system that enables sharing of information using the internet.</li>
                    <strong>In other words:</strong> The internet and the web are the fundamental technologies on which websites are based. <br>
                    <h1>So what happens, exactly?</h1>
                    When you type a web address into your browser (for our case we're accessing an online): <br>
            <strong>1.</strong> The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server <br>
                            that the website lives on (you find the address of the shop). <br>
            <strong>2.</strong> The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send <br>
                            a copy of the website to the client (you go to the shop and order your goods). <br>
                            This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, <br>
                            is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP. <br>
            <strong>3.</strong> If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client <br>
                            a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", <br>
                            and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks <br>
                            called data packets (the shop gives you your goods, and you bring them back to your house). <br>
            <strong>4.</strong> The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays <br>
                            it to you (the goods arrive at your door — new shiny stuff, awesome!). <br>

            <h1>How to become a web developer?</h1>
            <p>
                To become a Web Developer, you should have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
                It’s also recommended to learn about CSS and CSS frameworks. Developing these fundamental <br>
                web development skills will give you the foundation and logic for communicating with programming languages.</p>

                <h1>1. Learn Web Development Fundamentals</h1>
                <div>
                <p>The best first step to becoming a Web Developer is to start learning web development <br>
                    fundamentals, including an understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS <br>
                    (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. <br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>In fact, the practical advantages of coding boot camps are only getting clearer over time. For one <br>
                    thing, the field of web development naturally attracts people from all other fields, many of them <br>
                    making mid-career transitions – people for whom a clear and efficient path to skills expansion is <br>
                    a top priority. Further, employers increasingly value skills and experience over education, placing <br>
                    anyone who can prove their abilities on more equal footing with Developers holding a college degree.

            <h2>2. Choose a Development Specialization</h2>
            <p>
                <div>
                As you continue to grow your skills, you’ll need to choose an area of specialization. But what are <br>
                the types of web development? All Web Developers are categorized into three main types:</p> <br> </div>
                <div>
                <strong>Front-End Developer:</strong> A Front-End Developer works on the “client-side” of web <br>
                development, meaning any portion of the site or app that users interact with. This can include <br>
                a site’s layout, design, and the way users interact with it.<br>
                <img src="front-end-development.jpg" width="200"><br>
                <strong>Back-End Developer:</strong> A Back-End Developer works on the “server-side” of web development. <br>
                This is focused on the way a site functions and can include databases, servers, networks and hosting, and more.<br>
                <img src="back-end-development.jpg" width="200"><br>
                <strong>Full-Stack Developer:</strong> A Full-Stack Developer is familiar with both front-and back-end <br>
                development and works with both sides of a website.<br>
                <img src="full-stack.jpeg" width="400"></div>
        </div>
                <h1>3. Learn Key Programming Languages for Web Development</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Whatever your area of concentration, you’ll need to know how to use a handful of different <br>
                    programming languages for web development and web design. So, what are the most common <br>
                    programming languages? <br> 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Three families of programming languages form the basic tools involved in virtually all aspects of <br>
                    web development: <br>
                </p>
            </div> 
                <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <img src="main wd.png" width="300">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Of course, the list goes on – these are just the beginning. In fact, web development is such a <br>
                        diverse and varied field that the list of all the tasks it can include (and all the coding languages <br>
                        and markup languages you might use to accomplish them) is too long to fit in this space. <br>
                        Fortunately, as a specialist, you can find and concentrate on the ones that work best for you. <br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h1>What is Needed to Become a Web Developer?</h1>
                <p>Here are some of the things you’ll need to learn to become a Web Developer</p>
                <img src="wd2.svg" width="700">
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Foundations: </strong>To become a Web Developer, you should develop a comprehensive <br>
                        understanding of how the web works. This will deepen your HTML and CSS knowledge to build <br>
                        and style more advanced static web pages. </p>
                    <p><strong>Programming fundamentals: </strong>Foundational knowledge of JavaScript and object-oriented <br>
                        programming should be a starting point for aspiring Web Developers, as it will improve your <br>
                        ability to write and build components.</p>
                    <p><strong>Front-end frameworks: </strong>It’s important for aspiring Web Developers to learn how to use React, <br>
                        a JavaScript framework, to build complex and dynamic web pages and professional-level user interfaces.</p>
                    <p><strong>Web servers: </strong>To become a Web Developer, you’ll need to know how to build servers using a <br>
                        modern back-end framework and how to develop custom APIs and serve static websites and files.</p>
                    <p><strong>Server-side programming: </strong>It’s important for Web Developers to have an understanding of <br>
                        Server Side Rendering and Templating Engines, which are used to create empty page templates <br>
                        populated with dynamic data, such as a series of product pages for an eCommerce store.</p>
                    <p><strong>Databases: </strong>Aspiring Web Developers will also have to understand core concepts around data <br>
                        and learn how to manage databases and data on a web server.</p>
                </div>
                <h1>
                    What is the role of a Web Developer?
                </h1>
                <p>A good Web Developer must</p>
                <img src="teamwork.svg" width="300">
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Write Working Code: </strong>He/she must a sharp eye for details and is constantly scanning code for anything that looks <br>
                        “off.” They write clean code that is well structured and uses tools to identify potential errors before the code runs. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Write Code That Works Correctly: </strong> Just because the code works, doesn’t mean it works correctly. <br>
                        Getting the code to work is only the first hurdle. All errors missed by Developers will cause program crashes, <br>
                        system failure, data corruption, security breaches, or turn away users who expect reliability. <br>
                        These errors become increasingly expensive to fix as they find their way into production and are discovered by end-users. <br>
                        A good Developer, therefore, adopts a test-driven mindset, actively imagining all scenarios where errors can occur, <br>
                        how they should be handled, and writing tests that prove the code is correct. </p> <br>
                    <div>
                        <strong>Collaborate With Their Team</strong> While a Web Developer spends much of their time interacting with a computer, the reality of their <br>
                        work environment is social. It’s important to respect the team, know the roles, and responsibilities, and what’s expected. <br>
                        A good Developer will, therefore, spend the time needed to understand the company’s best practices and standards. <br>
                        They will also improve the development process in ways that save time and increase productivity. Most importantly, they will <br>
                        have to have a positive attitude that makes the workplace more productive and supportive. <br>

                        A good Developer recognizes that their career and reputation is their responsibility. <br>
                        They strive to be a pleasure to work with, and always find ways to make the workload of their team lighter and more efficient. <br>

                    <strong>Respect Timelines and Deadlines: </strong> A good Developer sets reasonable expectations, communicates openly about unexpected <br>
                    roadblocks, and maintains the trust of their team and other stakeholders. <br>
                    Estimating time on projects is a difficult task, as there are many unknown and unexpected <br>
                    problems that come up when building complex software. Yet underestimating time to delivery is dangerous, <br>
                    creating stress and burnout, the pressure to cut corners, and negative feelings from all stakeholders in the project.
